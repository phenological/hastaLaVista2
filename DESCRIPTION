Description: To connect R results to https://github.com/cheminfo/nmrium project using https://www.nmrium.org/nmrium.
    This allows to interactively display NMR and Mass spectra into the browser.
    R is a powerfull software for data analysis, however it lacks the possibility to display data in an interactive fashion.
    For example it is not possible to display a spectra and zoom in and out. With this package we offer the possibility apply nmr
    analysis in the browser, like, phase correctoin, peak picking, integration and assignment.
